# Instructions

1. Modulo can also be used to determine the day of the week given a start and end day. For our exercise, we are going to assume that we are starting on the first (represented by 0) day of the week and we want to figure out if n (program starts at 13) days go by, what day of the week is it now.

   - For the first step, set the initial values for `daysThatPass` (any positive integer you like) and `daysInWeek` (7) during their declaration.

2. Your task is to use modulo logic to determine the day of the week it will be after n days pass.

   - Store the result in `endingDayOfWeek`. If you need help figuring out what you would need to do to calculate this, take a look at the hint.
