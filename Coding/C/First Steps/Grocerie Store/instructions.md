# Creating the Variables

1. First things first, let’s create our variables where we will store all our information in during our program. We will want the number of apples in inventory, call this `appleQuantity`.

2. Next, add the current price of apples, call it `applePrice`. Keep in mind that we are storing a currency value in this variable; should that be a `float` or a `double`?

3. We will also want to store the average user review, call it `appleReview`. Since this is storing customer reviews as a decimal (0.52), should it be a `float` or a `double`?

4. Create an `int` to store the review score we want to display to users, call this `appleReviewDisplay`.

5. Finally, we need to know where to find the apples in the store. Call this variable `appleLocation`. We will want to be able to store a single letter or number in this field, what should we declare its type to be?

# Assigning Values

6. Now that we have our variables created, it’s time to populate them with values. When you first create your variables, we already know the price of apples and the location they will be kept. At declaration, set the price of apples to 1.49 and the location to 'F'.

7. After declaration, your program will get the information for the quantity of apples and the average user review. Below your variable declaration, set the quantity of apples to 23 and the average review for apples is a respectable 82.5.

# Constants

8. We want to make sure customers can always find apples, so make sure the location variable can’t be changed from what is set at declaration.
