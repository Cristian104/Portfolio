### tmux

#### Theory
tmux is a terminal multiplexer that allows you to split your terminal window into multiple panes or windows, each of which can run its own command or application. It's similar in concept to the screen utility, but with a number of additional features and capabilities.

Some of the key features of tmux include:

    Multiple panes: You can split your terminal window into multiple panes, each of which can run its own command or application. This allows you to easily monitor multiple processes or perform multiple tasks in the same terminal window.

    Multiple windows: You can create multiple windows, each of which can have its own set of panes. This allows you to organize your terminal sessions into separate workspaces or projects.

    Session management: You can save and restore tmux sessions, so you can quickly resume your work from where you left off.

    Customization: tmux is highly customizable, with a wide range of configuration options and the ability to create custom key bindings and scripts.
